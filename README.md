# Captcha-Classification

# Description
The project aims to classify digits in CAPTCHA images. Each image contains three digits, which are either 3, 4, or 5. The task is to identify each digit from the images using image processing techniques and machine learning methods. 
The visual analysis of the images in the dataset reveals several challenges in the dataset. These include noise, blur, overlapping digits, and varying orientations of digits. Repetitive slanted lines and scratch-like patterns are also present around the digits. 
Different image analysis and machine-learning techniques have been used to address these issues.
